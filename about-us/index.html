      Something here about having the best of both worlds because we are both a
      designer and developer. We also both have understanding of design and developing.
      Also that we are a sister team. We use contracted developers and
      designers as well. We love working together!

          Katelyn dabbled a little in coding for the past few years until about a year
          ago discovering that she had a real passion for it. She worked hard,
          obtained the knowledge she needed to take her to the next level and is now
          ready to take on the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          When she is not coding she enjoys spending time with her amazing husband
          and two adorable kids. She also loves to be outside and loves to write.

        Something here to sum up what we are and what we do. Maybe a saying or
        a slogan. Or we could put here that we hire contracted developers and de-
        signers when needed.
